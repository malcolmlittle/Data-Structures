# Which of the following are equivalent to O(n)? Why?

# 1. O(N + P), where P < N/2        --p is less than n therefore nondominant and can be dropped
# 2. O(2n)      --constant can be dropped
# 3. O(n + log n)   --log n non dominant can be dropped


# 4. O(n + n log n)     --drop n cause nondominant so this is not equal to O(n) and is instead equal to O(n log n)
# 5. O(n + m)       -- note that a relationship isn't established between n & m so wee need to keep both variables

# 1, 2, & 3
